# Fibonacci Sequence Sum Calculator

This project implements a C program that calculates the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.

## Files

- `src/code.c`: Contains the C source code for the Fibonacci sequence and the function to calculate the sum of even-valued terms.
- `Makefile`: Automates the build process for compiling the C source code into an executable.

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the `code.c` file and create an executable.

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the executable with the following command:

```
./code
```

This will execute the program and display the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
